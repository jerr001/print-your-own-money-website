            Print Your Own Money: A Motivational Blueprint for Turning Ideas
            into Value and Value into Wealth
          </h1>
          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            Print Your Money is a reflective and practical guide for anyone who
            wants to understand how money is actually created—without hype,
            shortcuts, or get-rich-quick illusions. Instead of focusing on money
            itself, the book shifts attention to what comes first: ideas,
            learning, discipline, service, creativity, faith, and consistency.
            Gideon Ijidakinro invites readers to rethink income not as something
            chased, but as something that flows from value intentionally
            developed over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Written in clear, human language, the book challenges passive
            thinking and encourages readers to take responsibility for
            growth—personally, spiritually, and practically. It speaks
            especially to beginners, creatives, and thoughtful individuals who
            want meaning alongside provision. You may not control the
            economy—but you can develop the person who creates value within it.
          </p>
